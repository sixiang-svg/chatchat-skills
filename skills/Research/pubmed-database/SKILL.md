# Biopython: Computational Molecular Biology in Python

## Overview

Biopython is a comprehensive set of freely available Python tools for biological computation. It provides functionality for sequence manipulation, file I/O, database access, structural bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and many other bioinformatics tasks. The current version is **Biopython 1.85** (released January 2025), which supports Python 3 and requires NumPy.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Working with biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein)
- Reading, writing, or converting biological file formats (FASTA, GenBank, FASTQ, PDB, mmCIF, etc.)
- Accessing NCBI databases (GenBank, PubMed, Protein, Gene, etc.) via Entrez
- Running BLAST searches or parsing BLAST results
- Performing sequence alignments (pairwise or multiple sequence alignments)
- Analyzing protein structures from PDB files
- Creating, manipulating, or visualizing phylogenetic trees
- Finding sequence motifs or analyzing motif patterns
- Calculating sequence statistics (GC content, molecular weight, melting temperature, etc.)
- Performing structural bioinformatics tasks
- Working with population genetics data
- Any other computational molecular biology task

## Core Capabilities

Biopython is organized into modular sub-packages, each addressing specific bioinformatics domains:

1. **Sequence Handling** - Bio.Seq and Bio.SeqIO for sequence manipulation and file I/O
2. **Alignment Analysis** - Bio.Align and Bio.AlignIO for pairwise and multiple sequence alignments
3. **Database Access** - Bio.Entrez for programmatic access to NCBI databases
4. **BLAST Operations** - Bio.Blast for running and parsing BLAST searches
5. **Structural Bioinformatics** - Bio.PDB for working with 3D protein structures
6. **Phylogenetics** - Bio.Phylo for phylogenetic tree manipulation and visualization
7. **Advanced Features** - Motifs, population genetics, sequence utilities, and more

## Installation and Setup

Install Biopython using pip (requires Python 3 and NumPy):

For NCBI database access, always set your email address (required by NCBI):


## Using This Skill

This skill provides comprehensive documentation organized by functionality area. When working on a task, consult the relevant reference documentation:

### 1. Sequence Handling (Bio.Seq & Bio.SeqIO)

Use for:
- Creating and manipulating biological sequences
- Reading and writing sequence files (FASTA, GenBank, FASTQ, etc.)

- Working with SeqRecord objects

### 2. Alignment Analysis (Bio.Align & Bio.AlignIO)

Use for:
- Pairwise sequence alignment (global and local)
- Reading and writing multiple sequence alignments
- Using substitution matrices (BLOSUM, PAM)
- Calculating alignment statistics
- Customizing alignment parameters

### 3. Database Access (Bio.Entrez)

Use for:

- Calculating distances, angles, and dihedrals
- Secondary structure assignment (DSSP)
- Structure superimposition and RMSD calculation
- Extracting sequences from structures


### 6. Phylogenetics (Bio.Phylo)

Use for:

- Building trees from distance matrices or alignments
- Tree manipulation (pruning, rerooting, ladderizing)
- Calculating phylogenetic distances
- Creating consensus trees
- Visualizing trees


### 7. Advanced Features

Use for:

- **Population genetics** (Bio.PopGen) - GenePop files, Fst calculations, Hardy-Weinberg tests
- **Sequence utilities** (Bio.SeqUtils) - GC content, melting temperature, molecular weight, protein analysis
- **Restriction analysis** (Bio.Restriction) - Finding restriction enzyme sites
- **Clustering** (Bio.Cluster) - K-means and hierarchical clustering
- **Genome diagrams** (GenomeDiagram) - Visualizing genomic features


## General Workflow Guidelines

### Reading Documentation

When a user asks about a specific Biopython task:

1. **Identify the relevant module** based on the task description
2. **Read the appropriate reference file** using the Read tool
3. **Extract relevant code patterns** and adapt them to the user's specific needs
4. **Combine multiple modules** when the task requires it

### Writing Biopython Code

Follow these principles when writing Biopython code:

1. **Import modules explicitly**

2. **Set Entrez email** when using NCBI databases

3. **Use appropriate file formats** - Check which format best suits the task

4. **Handle files properly** - Close handles after use or use context managers

5. **Use iterators for large files** - Avoid loading everything into memory

6. **Handle errors gracefully** - Network operations and file parsing can fail

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fetch Sequence from GenBank


### Pattern 2: Sequence Analysis Pipeline

### Pattern 3: BLAST and Fetch Top Hits

### Pattern 4: Build Phylogenetic Tree from Sequences


## Best Practices

1. **Always read relevant reference documentation** before writing code
2. **Use grep to search reference files** for specific functions or examples
3. **Validate file formats** before parsing
4. **Handle missing data gracefully** - Not all records have all fields
5. **Cache downloaded data** - Don't repeatedly download the same sequences
6. **Respect NCBI rate limits** - Use API keys and proper delays
7. **Test with small datasets** before processing large files
8. **Keep Biopython updated** to get latest features and bug fixes
9. **Use appropriate genetic code tables** for translation
10. **Document analysis parameters** for reproducibility

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No handlers could be found for logger 'Bio.Entrez'"
**Solution:** This is just a warning. Set Entrez.email to suppress it.

### Issue: "HTTP Error 400" from NCBI
**Solution:** Check that IDs/accessions are valid and properly formatted.

### Issue: "ValueError: EOF" when parsing files
**Solution:** Verify file format matches the specified format string.

### Issue: Alignment fails with "sequences are not the same length"
**Solution:** Ensure sequences are aligned before using AlignIO or MultipleSeqAlignment.

### Issue: BLAST searches are slow
**Solution:** Use local BLAST for large-scale searches, or cache results.

### Issue: PDB parser warnings
**Solution:** Use `PDBParser(QUIET=True)` to suppress warnings, or investigate structure quality.


## Summary

Biopython provides comprehensive tools for computational molecular biology. When using this skill:

1. **Identify the task domain** (sequences, alignments, databases, BLAST, structures, phylogenetics, or advanced)
2. **Consult the appropriate reference file** in the `references/` directory
3. **Adapt code examples** to the specific use case
4. **Combine multiple modules** when needed for complex workflows
5. **Follow best practices** for file handling, error checking, and data management

The modular reference documentation ensures detailed, searchable information for every major Biopython capability.
