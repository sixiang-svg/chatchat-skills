## Getting Started

### Step 1: Authentication Setup

Before using any protocols.io API functionality:

1. Obtain an access token (CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN or OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN)
2. Read `references/authentication.md` for detailed authentication procedures
3. Store the token securely
4. Include in all requests as: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Identify Your Use Case

Determine which capability area addresses your needs.

### Step 3: Implement Integration

Follow the guidance in the relevant reference files:

- Each reference includes detailed endpoint documentation
- API parameters and request/response formats are specified
- Common use cases and workflows are provided with examples
- Best practices and error handling guidance included

## Base URL and Request Format

All API requests use the base URL:
```
https://protocols.io/api/v3
```

All requests require the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Most endpoints support JSON request/response format with `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Content Format Options

Many endpoints support a `content_format` parameter to control how protocol content is returned:

- `json`: Draft.js JSON format (default)
- `html`: HTML format
- `markdown`: Markdown format

Include as query parameter: `?content_format=html`

## Rate Limiting

Be aware of API rate limits:

- **Standard endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **PDF endpoint**: 5 requests/minute (signed-in), 3 requests/minute (unsigned)

Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors (HTTP 429).

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Import and Analyze Protocol

To analyze an existing protocol from protocols.io:

1. **Search**: Use `GET /protocols` with keywords to find relevant protocols
2. **Retrieve**: Get full details with `GET /protocols/{protocol_id}`
3. **Extract**: Parse steps, materials, and metadata for analysis
4. **Review discussions**: Check `GET /protocols/{id}/comments` for user feedback
5. **Export**: Generate PDF if needed for offline reference

### Workflow 2: Create and Publish Protocol

To create a new protocol and publish with DOI:

1. **Authenticate**: Ensure you have valid access token (see `authentication.md`)
2. **Create**: Use `POST /protocols` with title and description
3. **Add steps**: For each step, use `POST /protocols/{id}/steps`
4. **Add materials**: Document reagents in step components
5. **Review**: Verify all content is complete and accurate
6. **Publish**: Issue DOI with `POST /protocols/{id}/publish`

### Workflow 3: Collaborative Lab Workspace

To set up team protocol management:

1. **Create/join workspace**: Access or request workspace membership (see `workspaces.md`)
2. **Organize structure**: Create folder hierarchy for lab protocols (see `file_manager.md`)
3. **Create protocols**: Use `POST /workspaces/{id}/protocols` for team protocols
4. **Upload files**: Add experimental data and images
5. **Enable discussions**: Team members can comment and provide feedback
6. **Track experiments**: Document protocol executions with experiment records

### Workflow 4: Experiment Documentation

To track protocol executions and results:

1. **Execute protocol**: Perform protocol in laboratory
2. **Upload data**: Use File Manager API to upload results (see `file_manager.md`)
3. **Create record**: Document execution with `POST /protocols/{id}/runs`
4. **Link files**: Reference uploaded data files in experiment record
5. **Note modifications**: Document any protocol deviations or optimizations
6. **Analyze**: Review multiple runs for reproducibility assessment

### Workflow 5: Protocol Discovery and Citation

To find and cite protocols in research:

1. **Search**: Query published protocols with `GET /publications`
2. **Filter**: Use category and keyword filters for relevant protocols
3. **Review**: Read protocol details and community comments
4. **Bookmark**: Save useful protocols with `POST /protocols/{id}/bookmarks`
5. **Cite**: Use protocol DOI in publications (proper attribution)
6. **Export PDF**: Generate formatted PDF for offline reference


## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**: Store tokens securely, never in code or version control
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and respect rate limits
3. **Error Handling**: Handle all HTTP error codes appropriately
4. **Data Validation**: Validate input before API calls
5. **Documentation**: Document protocol steps thoroughly
6. **Collaboration**: Use comments and discussions for team communication
7. **Organization**: Maintain consistent naming and tagging conventions
8. **Versioning**: Track protocol versions when making updates
9. **Attribution**: Properly cite protocols using DOIs
10. **Backup**: Regularly export important protocols and workspace data

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication Issues:**
- Verify token is valid and not expired
- Check Authorization header format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
- Ensure appropriate token type (CLIENT vs OAUTH)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
- Monitor request frequency
- Consider caching frequent requests

**Permission Errors:**
- Verify workspace/protocol access permissions
- Check user role in workspace
- Ensure protocol is not private if accessing without permission

**File Upload Failures:**
- Check file size against workspace limits
- Verify file type is supported
- Ensure multipart/form-data encoding is correct
